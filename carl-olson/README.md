# Kilovolt Blog 05-Form-Building

**Author**: Carl Olson
**Version**: 1.0.0 

## Overview
This is an extension of the Kilovolt blog project for Code Fellows 301. This particular portion is focused on implementing a form to be able to add a new blog entry from the website.

## Getting Started
The user would need to 
* Create index.html
* Get the icons from IcoMoon
* Get the normalize.css from github.com/necolas/normalize.css
* Search and find images of bacon, baseball, and cats
* Add filler text
* Build CSS files according to SMACSS methodology
* Include link to jQuery library (CDN)
* Create the articles as objects within an array with consistent property values
* Create a constructor function to make the article array accessible to the constructor's method
* Use Handlebars.js to populate html elements with article values
* Create forEach loops to generate new object instances and then append them to the DOM
* Add a new.html page that includes a form with inputs for a new blog entry.
* Have the data from the form be JSONstringified so that we can add it to the blogArticles.js and have it included with the other articles. 
* Show a preview of the new entry below the form that is updating once an input has been filled out.


## Architecture
I used HTML, CSS, Markdown, JavaScript, jQuery, Handlebars.js
